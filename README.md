# updatedPortfolio

Goal
This repository was created to contain an updated version of my portfolio.  It has a different style than the first two versions.  The Contact Me page has been removed.  My contact information is now contained in the footer on two of the three pages.  There are links to my LinkedIn,GitHub, Twitter, and Google Plus profiles.  My email and resume have also been added.

Technical Description
This portfolio contains three html pages.  The pages are styled using the Bootstrap CDN and custom CSS.  

Collateral Changes
My LinkedIn profile has been updated to include several of my projects.  Projects were pinned to my GitHub home page and ReadMe.md files have been updated for those projects.
