              Chuck Norris once tried to wear glasses. The result was him seeing
              around the world to the point where he was looking at the back of
              his own head. Chuck Norris is ten feet tall, weighs two-tons,
              breathes fire, and could eat a hammer and take a shotgun blast
              standing. When asked what type of vehicle he drives, Chuck Norris
              responded slyly with “Don’t you mean what kind of vehicle drives
              me?” Chuck Norris drinks napalm to quell his heartburn. Chuck
              Norris put humpty dumpty back together again, only to roundhouse
              kick him in the face. Later Chuck dined on scrambled eggs with all
              the king’s horses and all the king’s men. The king himself could
              not attend for unspecified reasons. Coincidentally, the autopsoy
              revealed the cause of death to be a roundhouse kick to the face.
              There is only one King. Filming on location for Walker: Texas
              Ranger, Chuck Norris brought a stillborn baby lamb back to life by
              giving it a prolonged beard rub. Shortly after the farm animal
              sprang back to life and a crowd had gathered, Chuck Norris
              roundhouse kicked the animal, breaking its neck, to remind the
              crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh
              away. If you have five dollars and Chuck Norris has five dollars,
              Chuck Norris has more money than you. Chuck Norris doesn’t worry
              about changing his clock twice a year for daylight savings time.
              The sun rises and sets when Chuck tells it to. Crop circles are
              Chuck Norris’ way of telling the world that sometimes corn needs
              to lie the f*ck down. If Chuck Norris is late, time better slow
              the f*ck down Chuck Norris is 1/8th Cherokee. This has nothing to
              do with ancestry, the man ate a f*cking Indian. Chuck Norris eats
              transformer toys in vehicle mode and poos them out transformed
              into a robot. If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you
              can’t see Chuck Norris you may be only seconds away from death.
